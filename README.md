# TypingGame

This is a simple typing game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game randomly generates a word, and the user has to type the word within a certain time limit to earn points. The game keeps track of the user's accuracy, error and displays it on the screen.

## Getting Started

To get started with the TypingGame repo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start playing the game!

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, a word will appear at the top of the screen.
2. Type the word as quickly as possible and hit enter.
3. If you typed the word correctly within the time limit, you'll earn points.
4. If you didn't type the word correctly, you won't earn any points.
5. The game will generate a new word for you to type, and the cycle will continue.
6. The game will end after a certain amount of time, and your final score will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following variables in the `index.js` file:

1. `timeLimit`: The amount of time in seconds that the user has to type each word.
2. `scoreIncrement`: The number of points the user earns for typing a word correctly.
